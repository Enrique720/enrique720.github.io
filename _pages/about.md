I am a motivated second year Ph.D. student at [The University of New Mexico](https://unm.edu), Albuquerque, NM. I started my Ph.D. program in Fall 2024. I am very passionate about cybersecurity, with penetration testing being one of my favorite fields. For that reason, you will find me playing a lot on Hack the Box.

Research
======
I am working as a Research Assistant, advised by [Prof. Afsah Anwar](https://afsah.org) at UNM. As an RA, my main research focus is mobile security in Virtual Private Networks (VPN). In this research, I focus on identifying security concerns within VPN applications. Moreover, I am actively engaged with the cybersecurity community at UNM, where I lead a cybersecurity group that actively participates in CTF competitions.
