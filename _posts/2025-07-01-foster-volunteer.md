I am volunteering with the Bosque Buddies Animal Rescue organization to help foster puppies in need of loving homes. Currently, I am fostering a playful puppy named Penny. As a foster volunteer, I provide Penny with a safe and caring environment, help her adjust to home life, and support her journey toward adoption. This experience has been rewarding and has allowed me to contribute to animal welfare in my community.

Below a picture of Penny and me during a coding session:
