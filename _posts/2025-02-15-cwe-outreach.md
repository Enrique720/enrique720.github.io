I often like to do extracurricular activities to help the science community. This time I volunteer for the Center for the Water and Environment (CWE) and helped in an outreach activity


Activity
======
The Center for the Water and Environment is an organization at UNM that aims to impact the planet by developing novel techniques to treat and analyze water bodies. 

This year, I volunteered for an outreach activity at the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History, where I helped the CWE team to explain science to little kids.

It was a nice activity and felt the joy of children, happy to help again!
