I often like to participate in extracurricular activities to help the scientific community. This time, I volunteered for the Center for Water and the Environment (CWE) and helped in an outreach activity.


Activity
======
The Center for Water and the Environment is an organization at UNM that aims to impact the planet by developing novel techniques to treat and analyze water bodies.

This year, I volunteered for an outreach activity at the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History, where I helped the CWE team explain science to little kids.

It was a great activity, and I felt the joy of the childrenâ€”happy to help again!
