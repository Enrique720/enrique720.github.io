I am excited to announce the formation of a Capture The Flag (CTF) group (LoboSec) at the University of New Mexico (UNM). This group is dedicated to exploring the fascinating world of cybersecurity through hands-on challenges and competitions. This group is open to all students interested in learning more about cybersecurity, regardless of their prior experience. The LoboSec group aims to foster a collaborative environment where members can share knowledge, develop skills, and prepare for CTF competitions.
