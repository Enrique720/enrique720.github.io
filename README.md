# Enrique Sobrados â€” Personal Website

Welcome to my personal academic website! Here you can find information about my research, publications, teaching, portfolio projects, and outreach activities. I use this site to share my work, interests, and updates with the academic and professional community.

This website is built using the excellent [Academic Pages](https://academicpages.github.io/) template, which provides a flexible and professional foundation for academic portfolios. Credit for the template goes to its original authors and maintainers.

Feel free to explore the site and reach out if you have any questions or comments.
