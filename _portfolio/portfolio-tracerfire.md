During the Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC), I participated in a workshop called TracerFire, organized by Sandia National Laboratories. This workshop has a two-day CTF where different teams participate to reconstruct a hacking scenario. The CTF was focused on forensics and our task was to many different flags along the way. We used tools like kibana, autopsy, volatility, suricata, and velociraptor.

After two long days of continous trying and finding, my team and I were able to obtain the first place! We had a very good time and enjoyed finding those flags! Thank you Mike and Lorenzo! Below a picture of the great experience.
