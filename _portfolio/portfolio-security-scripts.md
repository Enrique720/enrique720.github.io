Explore the scripts in the [SecurityScripts repo](https://github.com/Enrique720/SecurityScripts).

This project is a collection of Python scripts designed to automate and simplify various security-related tasks. The scripts cover areas such as vulnerability scanning, password auditing, network reconnaissance, and more. Each script is documented and can be used independently or as part of a larger security workflow.

Key features:
- Automate repetitive security checks
- Easily customizable for different environments
- Useful for both students and professionals in cybersecurity

Below is a screenshot of my favorite nmap command, which is part of the collection:
