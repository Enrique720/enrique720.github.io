Check the project in the following [repo](https://github.com/Enrique720/CVE_Database_API).

This project aims to help students and researchers obtain faster and unlimited response time for API calls for CVEs. By launching a Flask server in your local host, the website will automatically extract all the CVE database from the National Vulnerability Database and provide with a local API so you can make request without a threshold.

This project also provides an interactive website where you can visualize the CVE's most important information, filter by dates, etc.
