Check out the project in the following [repo](https://github.com/Enrique720/CVE_Database_API).

This project aims to help students and researchers obtain faster and unlimited response times for API calls related to CVEs. By launching a Flask server on your localhost, the website will automatically extract the entire CVE database from the National Vulnerability Database and provide a local API, allowing you to make requests without any rate limits.

The project also includes an interactive website where you can visualize the most important information about CVEs, filter by dates, and more.
