At Le Wagon, I worked as a Bootcamp teacher and workshop tutor for their intensive Web Development Bootcamp. This program is designed to teach students the fundamentals of web development, covering both front-end and back-end technologies, and preparing them for real-world software engineering roles.

Ruby-On-Rails
======
I gave lectures and answered questions on Slack on the following topics:
- Front End
- HTML, CSS, JS
- Bootstrap

Git/Github
======
I conducted several Git workshops to help students collaborate in an organized manner.
