In Fall 2023, I assisted Professor Joseph Haugh in the CS357 Declarative Programming course at the University of New Mexico. As a teaching assistant, I was responsible for grading exams and homework assignments, as well as delivering extra lectures to reinforce course concepts.

My main responsibilities included:
- Grading student exams and homework to ensure fair and consistent assessment.
- Providing additional lectures to clarify key topics and support student learning.
- Assisting students with questions and helping them understand declarative programming paradigms such as logic programming and functional programming.

Throughout the semester, I supported both the instructor and students to help create a positive learning environment.
