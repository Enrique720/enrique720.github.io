In Spring 2024, I helped Professor Afsah Anwar in the CS544 Intro to Cybersecurity course. As a TA, I was responsible for grading and developing course material for the following subjects:

Reverse Engineering
======
For this lab, I created a binary that students had to analyze in order to obtain the flags. The lab was designed to test students' creativity and problem-solving skills. Ghidra, GDB, and Radare2 were the tools used for this lab.


Injection Attacks
======
I created a lab exercise focused on exploring and learning about Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection. In this lab, students learned how to identify and perform reflected XSS attacks, enumerate database information, and exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities.


Network Scanning with NMAP
======
I developed a lab aimed at teaching the basics of network scanning. I also created documentation covering the various scanning options that Nmap offersâ€”including techniques for evading firewalls!
