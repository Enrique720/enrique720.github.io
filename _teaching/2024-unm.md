On Spring 2024, I helped Professor Afsah Anwar in the CS544 Intro to Cybersecurity course. As a TA, I took charge in grading and developing course material for the following subjects:

Reverse Engineering
======
For this laboratory, I created a binary that students had to analyze in order to obtain the flags. The lab was developed to test the students creativity and problem solving. Ghidra, gdb, and radare2 were the tools used for this lab.

Injection Attacks
======
I created a lab exercise that consists of exploring and learning about Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and SLQ Injection. In this lab, students learned how to identify and perform reflected XSS attack; enumerate databases information and exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

Network Scanning with NMAP
======
I developed a lab that aims to teach the basics of network scanning. I created documentation for the different scanning options nmap offers, including options to evade firewalls!
